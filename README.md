Most sites work on a token system. Here’s a quick breakdown:

Buy tokens in bundles—the bigger the bundle, the lower the price per token.
Tips: 1–50 tokens for small actions (wave, wink).

Group shows: split the cost with others—usually 15–30 tokens per minute.
Pro tip: Set token purchase limits inside your profile settings to avoid overspending.

Lower the video quality to 480p.
Close background apps.
